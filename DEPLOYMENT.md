## 🛠️ Configuration Files

All deployment files are already set up:

✅ `.nojekyll` - GitHub Pages configuration
✅ `public/.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed?

**Check the Actions tab:**
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click on the failed workflow
4. Read the error message

**Common Issues:**

1. **Node modules error:**
   ```bash
   # Delete package-lock.json and try again
   rm package-lock.json
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Remove package-lock"
   git push
   ```

2. **Build error:**
   ```bash
   # Test build locally first
   npm run build
   # If it works locally, push again
   ```

3. **Pages not enabled:**
   - Check Settings > Pages
   - Make sure "GitHub Actions" is selected

### Site Shows 404?

1. Wait 5 minutes (sometimes takes a bit)
2. Check if workflow completed (green checkmark)
3. Try accessing: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/hindu-marathi-festivals/`
4. Make sure repository name matches URL

### Assets Not Loading?

The app is configured for static export, so all assets should work. If not:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure all images use external URLs (Unsplash)

---

## 🌟 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want a custom domain like `festivals.yourdomain.com`?

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS settings with your domain provider
5. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

---

## 📊 View Deployment Status

### Check Build Status:
- **Actions tab**: See all deployments
- **Badge**: Add to README for status

### Add Status Badge (Optional):

Add this to your README.md:
```markdown
![Deploy Status](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hindu-marathi-festivals/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Repository can be public (your app is client-side only)
- No API keys or secrets are exposed
- All data is in JSON files (safe to commit)
- Images are from external URLs (Unsplash)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test locally before pushing:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx serve@latest out
   ```

2. **Preview deployment:**
   - Every push shows preview in Actions

3. **Rollback if needed:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

4. **Multiple environments:**
   - Use branches: `main` (production), `dev` (development)
